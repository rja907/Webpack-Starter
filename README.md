# Webpack Starter

Solidifying my knowledge about Webpack.

## Repo workflow:

`Run 'npm i --save-dev webpack'.`

`Make webpack.config.js in the root directory.`

`Set an entry point and output config.`

`Make a script in the package.json file for webpack.`

`Run 'npm run build'.`

`Make an HTML file and add script tag giving bundle.js as source`

`Check to see that there is a log in the console.`

`Run 'npm i --save-dev babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env'.`

`Make .babelrc and make edits in webpack.config.js`

`Make an image viewer file.`

`Run 'npm i --save-dev css-loader style-loader'.`

`Add a CSS file.`

`Run 'npm i extract-text-webpack-plugin'.`

`Make changes in Webpack so that it stores the styling in a css file.`

`Run 'npm i --save-dev image-webpack-loader url-loader'.`

`Make changes in the webpack.config.js file and corresponding to compress the image files.`

`Edit image_viewer.js to add System.import call for code splitting. This will make multiple bundle.js files so that the page load is faster.`

This repo doesn't have much to show.
